# Legacy C program with GO language

This is the repository of the code of the web article I wrote to explain how we successfully integrated the GO language to leverate our legacy C software in a really soft manner.

## Prerequisites

- Windows
- Go lang
- MSYS2
- CMake

## How to compile

I tried to keep things simple. Just compile it with CMake.
However there is a `README.md` file in each part of the article.
